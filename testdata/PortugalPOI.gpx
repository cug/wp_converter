    <cmt>Very pleasant campsite with good facilities, swimming pool, bar and an atmospheric restaurant (sitting inside or on the patio) The owner and staff are very friendly and helpful. 
There are few friendly dogs and cats (and guinea pigs!) on the campground but as far as we know your pet is welcome and apparently the resident dogs are quite chilled out and friendly with camping doggies.
When you come and stay here, make sure there&#39;s a Wednesday night for you to enjoy and experience the best (authentic) pizza dish! Baked by a fabulous Italian/Belgian couple using their home grown organic ingredients and baked in the outside wood-fired pizza oven. An absolute must and very pleasant experience! (these Wednesday Pizza night are only at season time from Easter - October) And of course there&#39;s no pizza without a nice bottle of cold beer (good selection of Belgian and Portuguese beers)

    <cmt>Tourbus compartment or sleeping berth at campsite Ingrina near Vila do Bispo in the nature reserve.

I was here with my motorbike in May (Touring cbf 600) looking for a safe base for my luggage and my bike. It was perfect. Motorcycle parked next to bus. I stayed 3 weeks.
Had a compartment in the upper flor of &quot;Roman&#39;s Tourbus&quot; (ask at the gate of the Camping vor check air bnb). 1night / ~ 14, - € (depends how you book/stay) . Use of all facilities of Ingrina Camping (older campsite but its clean and  uncomplicated, reliable hot showers when I was here!). At night starry sky and Milky Way through open roof hatch in the 2-beds-compartment :-) 

  I left my havy luggage in the bus and I made several motorcycle tours through the West Algarve, Monchique Mountains and visited several beaches (often unpaved roads). 
Very quiet, in the middle of nature - beautifull beaches also on foot accessible. Roman is a friendly and helpful host.

    <cmt>Mountain biking trail system near Murça with a vast network of fire roads and areas along side them to park a vehicle or pitch a tent. The section of road we drove required no 4x4 or off-road capabilities. The area has been extremely quite over the day that we have been here, we haven&#39;t encountered anyone else. However I cannot say this for all year round as there seems to be a mountain biking event on at some stage in the year (most likely winter due to the hot summers). We parked at the crest of a hill and pitched a tent on a flat area away from the nearest main road

    <cmt>One of the very best campsites we found in Portugal. Place is definitely open. There are some fence works going on along the access road but only along the sides of the road. A big work truck was blocking the way, but as soon as we pulled up the workers came over and moved it for us and were very friendly. To get to the actual campsite you 100% need 4x4, good tires and good sand driving skills and confidence. Lots of deep sand that will swallow you if you are not careful. Once you get there it is a paradise all to yourself. Pristine sand beaches and great surf

    <cmt>Great, big camping area offered for free by the (very small) community. No reception, no registration, just enjoy. With shade (!), Boules game court (jeu de boules), football area, tennis court, BBQ spot, benches, water taps, toilets and (open) showers. Directly next to a nice artificial lake were you can have a nice swim. Very quiet, especially during the night, no barking dogs !

Just 10 min by foot to the (only) cafe (best hamburger and pastels de bacalhau, wifi) in the centre and 15 min to the (only) restaurant (with weekdays menus at €7.50) and a la carte in the weekends (€10 to €15). Multibanco atm and two small groceries are also available. 

One drawback : Eriera is famous for it&#39;s rice fields. That means huge areas of water. With beautiful storches and with musquitos. They attack from sunset for some 2 to 3 hours. But you can sit at the other side of the waterpool, and in the cafe  ;)

    <name>Isolated Paradise </name>
    <cmt>I offer a few campervans and tents pitches in my isolated paradise. A change of scenery is guaranteed in an old farm of 20 hectares away from the eyes and the neighbors, all in the middle of nature! 

About 5 places are available for campervans. 

We are in the early stages of the project but it is possible to use water from a garden hose, to recharge your batteries and to use the wifi near my house for an additional cost. It is forbidden to dispose of waste water! 

The sites are located in a freshly cut oat field, it is possible to walk around, observe the fauna and flora, swim in a dam, or even have a picnic. Smoking is strictly prohibited in the fields due to the high risk of fires!

Prices: 

The price is 10€ per night or 2 hours of work in the morning. I need help to move fences and other simple work . 

5€ to fill your water tank max 60 liters, water is a rare commodity here, I advise you to fill your tank elsewhere if possible)
4€ for the batteries to charge in my garage
2€ for the wifi

Proceeds will be used to fund the reforestation of the estate, to implement a project based on the benefit of a healing sound place, and to build an eco-camp with dry toilets, showers and outdoor kitchens.

Location:
The location indicated is very close to the actual location. Send me a message before your arrival at +351 968 360 034 so that I can give you the best route. The road is narrow and in bad condition but accessible.

Do not hesitate to contact me for more information!

Je mets à disposition quelques emplacements campervans et tentes dans mon paradis isolé. Dépaysement assuré dans une ancienne ferme de 20 hectares à l’abri des regards et des voisins, le tout en pleine nature ! 

Environ 5 places disponibles pour campervan. L’autonomie totale est conseillée pour profiter du lieu au mieux.

Nous sommes aux prémices du projet mais il est possible d’utiliser de l’eau depuis un tuyau d’arrosage, de recharger vos batteries et d’utiliser le wifi près de chez moi pour un coût supplémentaire. Il est interdit d’éliminer ses eaux usées ! 

Les emplacements se situent dans un champ d’avoine fraîchement coupé, il est possible de se balader, d’observer la faune et la flore, de se baigner dans un barrage, ou encore de piqueniquer. Il est strictement interdit de fumer dans les champs à cause des risques élevés d’incendies !

Prix : 

Le prix est de 10€ la nuit ou de 2h de travail en matinée. J’ai besoin d’aide pour déplacer des barrières et d’autres travaux assez simples. 

5€ pour remplir votre réservoir d’eau max 60 litres, l’eau est une denrée rare par ici, je vous conseille de remplir votre réservoir ailleurs si possible)
4€ pour les batteries à charger dans mon garage
2€ pour le wifi

Les recettes serviront à financer la reforestation du domaine, à mettre en œuvre un projet basé sur le bienfait des fréquences vibratoires, et à construire un éco-camping avec toilettes sèches, douches et cuisines extérieures.

Localisation :
La localisation indiquée est très proche de la localisation réelle. Envoyez-moi un message avant votre arrivée au  +351 968 360 034 afin que je vous indique le meilleur itinéraire. La route est étroite et en mauvais état mais accessible.

On Porto and in Lisbon have so many people living in the street and who want to say that you can&#39;t just sleep in the middle of the forest to surviver. You can ask this information in some guys specialist no for everyone who don&#39;t know. 

there is great poetry on the part of the Azibo administration Because in this park People who use cars also use tents they sleep inside the car they sleep outside the car in tents and this happens to many of the people who are inside the cars and also Some cyclist gets installed in the middle of cars to sleep with tents So there is a big lie on the part of the administration of Parque Azibo

only car, caravan, motorhome are allowed here, not tents, if you want to call to the administration of the park this is the number +351278420420 This rules are available for any place around the lake and river. They have some fiscalization, some ciclist are joining to the caravan people to have condition to sleep between the cars with tents.  You can find lot of spots and small beach around.

Informal campsite. A lot of campers and caravans stand here. Sound of planes landing and taking off until 11.30 PM. No electricity. Did not see any water spots as well. Nice place tough to meet other travelers.

There also a parking area next to the river and the cafe, but not very huge and not so good for bigger vans or big rigs. its really quiet at night. nobody bothered us. (4G with Orange). Free wifi in the cafe next to the public bath. Toilets and cold shower at the bath.

It’s a former motorhome for bikers who had their celebrations. Now it is a bit primitive campsite ran trough a mother and her son. If you like shadow…there’s not a lot. Amenities…one toilet and one cold shower. Bar/restaurant…the son will serve you drinks and custom made food if you like. So, it’s a bit alternative, but friendliness and the sound of nothing overrules everything! We paid 10,00 euros, they will charge you 2,50 extra if you need electricity.

Our goal was to recreate a feeling of wild camping, which is why we didn&#39;t create fixed pitches - pick your own spot! After a wonderfully relaxing day or night, you can jump under the (warm) outdoor shower under the almond tree with us.... In short; very close to nature and back to basics.

    <name>Camping on the cliffs</name>
    <cmt>Along the south side of the Peniche peninsula there are a couple of gravel roads (do able with 2wd). Along these roads there are heaps of fairly level pull outs, some sheltered, some in the open. Some roads are closer to the actual road but still far away enough to hear any noise. These roads are used by local fisherman to get to the cliffs where you can walk down via stairs (great to check out). Insane panoramic views! The marker i’ve put on the map, is a bigger pull out (but with big rocks) higher than the rest sheltered from the western winds. Enjoy!
